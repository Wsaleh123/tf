nn.py = Aritificial Neural Network for mnist hand written digit classification task. I used a five layer network with relu and softmax on the last layer. This file also includes learning rate decay, as well as dropout normalization function.

CNN.py = Convolutional Neural Network for mnist hand written digit classification task. I used 3 convolutional layers and 2 fully connected layers with softmax on the last layer. This file also includes learning rate decay, and dropout.

horseorhuman.py = Artificial Neural Network for classification task between horses and humans. I used 9 fully connected layers with softmax on the last layer. This file also includes learning rate decay, and dropout.

svm.py = Compares SVM and KNN algorithm accuracies with a classification task between red and blue coordinate points on a cartesian plane.
